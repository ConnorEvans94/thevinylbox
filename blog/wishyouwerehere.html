                <p>Wish you were here was Pink Floyd's 9th studio album, released on the 12th September 1975. 
                    Written by Roger Waters who also played the bass, David Gilmour on guitar, 
                    Nick Mason on the drums and Richard Wright on the keyboard. 
                    Guest appearances from Dick Parry on the saxophone (Shine On You Crazy Diamond), 
                    guest vocals from Roy Harper (Have A Cigar) and backing vocals by Venetta Fields and Carlena Williams.
                    Recorded at the famous Abbey Road Studio's in London, January to July 1975.
                    Engineered by Brian Humphries and assisted by Peter James. 
                    A double A-side was released prior to the album for promotion which featured the songs "Have A Cigar" and "Welcome To The Machine"
                    The whole album is a tribute to Syd Barrett who left the band several years earlier due to mental health problems. 
                    Roger described him as a crazy diamond, and felt deeply for his former bandmate.
                    Released by Harvest Records and EMI Records which the latter struggled to keep up with demand, its estimated the over 13 million copies have been sold</p>
